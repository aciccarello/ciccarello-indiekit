ðŸŽµ Listening to [Kind of Blue](https://album.link/us/i/268443092) by Miles Davis.

This is of my favorite jazz albums of all time. My parents got it for me when I was a kid playing trumpet in the school band. Compared to some of the other music I listen to, this album feels restrained but no less powerful.

I was really impressed with this memoir. The author clearly has experience with great story telling from working radio stories. She uses that skill in this book to weave together the timeline of her own experience understanding how her body's complex PTSD works in response to childhood trauma. The book is about her experience, it's not a how-to, but it offered a look at how our understanding of mental health has changed from decades past until now. At the same time, it raises questions about how our current system is not efficient at treating mental health. I highly recommend this book for anyone in the foster care community or those working through childhood trauma.

      This is one of those posts about a tech issue comes up from time to time
      for me that I find difficult to search for. Sorry (not sorry) if it is not
      helpful to anyone else!

        Too much context about my site building process

        

      My site is built with Hugo, a static site generator known for being quite
      fast, and with a powerful (and challenging) templating system.

      I use my site for lots of stuff, which sometimes means showing content
      from other sites in my posts. For example:

      I like seeing what people call the root folder in which they store their
      source code. This is the folder where all â€” or a lot of â€” your projects
      are stored. In my case, my programming projects go in a folder called src.
      (Although I have a strange habit of nesting personal projects that are
      related to each other. I believe my source code files are in need of a
      spring clean.)

      That long parenthetical notwithstanding, I find the name src cool. Itâ€™s a
      short way of saying source code; apt, simple, easâ€¦
