      This is one of those posts about a tech issue comes up from time to time
      for me that I find difficult to search for. Sorry (not sorry) if it is not
      helpful to anyone else!

        Too much context about my site building process

        

      My site is built with Hugo, a static site generator known for being quite
      fast, and with a powerful (and challenging) templating system.

      I use my site for lots of stuff, which sometimes means showing content
      from other sites in my posts. For example:

      short way of saying source code; apt, simple, eas…
